That's a big step toward becoming tobacco-free.</span></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(55, 58, 65);"">Many people don't quit </span><a href=""https://kidshealth.org/en/teens/smoking.html"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"" style=""color: rgb(0, 122, 100);"">smoking</a><span style=""color: rgb(55, 58, 65);""> because they think it's too hard. And it's true that for most people it's not easy. After all, the nicotine in cigarettes is a powerfully addictive drug. But with the right approach, you can overcome the cravings.</span></p><h3><span style=""color: rgb(13, 63, 99);"">Why Is it So Hard to Quit Smoking?</span></h3><p><span style=""color: rgb(55, 58, 65);"">Smokers often start smoking because friends or family do. But they keep smoking because they get addicted to nicotine, one of the chemicals in cigarettes and other tobacco products.</span></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(55, 58, 65);"">Nicotine has many effects on the body. It increases a person's heart rate, breathing rate, and blood pressure, and makes them feel more alert and in a good mood. But after smoking for a while, people start to depend on nicotine to feel good. If they don’t smoke, they become irritable or anxious or just don’t feel good. This is called </span><strong style=""color: rgb(55, 58, 65);"">nicotine withdrawal</strong><span style=""color: rgb(55, 58, 65);"">. They crave more cigarettes to perk up again. Some experts think the nicotine in tobacco is as addictive as cocaine or heroin.</span></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(55, 58, 65);"">But don't be discouraged — millions of people have permanently quit smoking. These tips can help you quit too.</span></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(55, 58, 65);""><br></span></p><h3><span style=""color: rgb(13, 63, 99);"">What Can Help Me Quit Smoking?</span></h3><p><strong style=""color: rgb(55, 58, 65);"">Put it in writing.</strong><span style=""color: rgb(55, 58, 65);""> People who want to make a change often are more successful when they put their goal in writing. Write down all the reasons why you want to quit smoking, like the money you'll save or the stamina you'll gain for playing sports. Keep that list where you can see it. Add new reasons as you think of them.</span></p><p><strong style=""color: rgb(55, 58, 65);"">Get support.</strong><span style=""color: rgb(55, 58, 65);""> People are more likely to succeed at quitting when friends and family help. If you don't want to tell your family that you smoke, ask friends to help you quit. Consider confiding in a counselor or other adult you trust. If it's hard to find people who support you (like if your friends smoke and aren't interested in quitting), join an online or in-person support group.</span></p><p><strong style=""color: rgb(55, 58, 65);"">Set a quit date.</strong><span style=""color: rgb(55, 58, 65);""> Pick a day that you'll stop smoking. Put it on your calendar and tell friends and family (if they know) that you'll quit on that day. Think of the day as a dividing line between the smoking you and the new, improved nonsmoker you'll become.</span></p><p><strong style=""color: rgb(55, 58, 65);"">Throw away your cigarettes</strong><span style=""color: rgb(55, 58, 65);""> — </span><strong style=""color: rgb(55, 58, 65);""><em>all</em></strong><strong style=""color: rgb(55, 58, 65);"">of them.</strong><span style=""color: rgb(55, 58, 65);""> People can't stop smoking with cigarettes around to tempt them. So get rid of everything, including ashtrays, lighters, and, yes, even that pack you stashed away for emergencies.</span></p><p><strong style=""color: rgb(55, 58, 65);"">Wash all your clothes.</strong><span style=""color: rgb(55, 58, 65);""> Get rid of the smell of cigarettes as much as you can by washing all your clothes and having your coats or sweaters dry-cleaned. If you smoked in your car, clean that out too.</span></p><p><strong style=""color: rgb(55, 58, 65);"">Think about your triggers.</strong><span style=""color: rgb(55, 58, 65);""> You're probably aware of the times when you tend to smoke, such as after meals, when you're at your best friend's house, while drinking coffee, or as you're driving. Any situation where it feels automatic to have a cigarette is a trigger. Once you've figured out your triggers, try these tips:</span></p><ol><li data-list=""bullet""><strong style=""color: rgb(55, 58, 65);"">Break the link.</strong><span style=""color: rgb(55, 58, 65);""> If you smoke when you drive, get a ride to school, walk, or take the bus for a few weeks so you can break the connection. If you normally smoke after meals, do something else after you eat, like go for a walk or talk to a friend.</span></li><li data-list=""bullet""><strong style=""color: rgb(55, 58, 65);"">Change the place.</strong><span style=""color: rgb(55, 58, 65);""> If you and your friends usually eat takeout in the car so you can smoke, sit in the restaurant instead.</span></li><li data-list=""bullet""><strong style=""color: rgb(55, 58, 65);"">Substitute something else for cigarettes.</strong><span style=""color: rgb(55, 58, 65);""> It can be hard to get used to not holding something or not having a cigarette in your mouth. If you have this problem, stock up on carrot sticks, sugar-free gum, mints, toothpicks, or lollipops.</span></li></ol><p><br></p><h3><span style=""color: rgb(13, 63, 99);"">How Can I Handle Withdrawal When I Quit Smoking?</span></h3><p><strong style=""color: rgb(55, 58, 65);"">Expect some physical symptoms.</strong><span style=""color: rgb(55, 58, 65);""> If your body is addicted to nicotine, you may go through withdrawal when you quit. Physical feelings of withdrawal can include:</span></p><ol><li data-list=""bullet""><span style=""color: rgb(55, 58, 65);"">headaches or stomachaches</span></li><li data-list=""bullet""><span style=""color: rgb(55, 58, 65);"">crabbiness, jumpiness, or </span><a href=""https://kidshealth.org/en/teens/depression.html"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"" style=""color: rgb(0, 122, 100);"">depression</a></li><li data-list=""bullet""><span style=""color: rgb(55, 58, 65);"">lack of energy</span></li><li data-list=""bullet""><span style=""color: rgb(55, 58, 65);"">dry mouth or sore throat</span></li><li data-list=""bullet""><span style=""color: rgb(55, 58, 65);"">a desire to eat</span></li></ol><p><span style=""color: rgb(55, 58, 65);"">The symptoms of nicotine withdrawal will pass — so be patient. Try not to give in and sneak a smoke because you'll just have to deal with the withdrawal longer.</span></p><p><strong style=""color: rgb(55, 58, 65);"">Keep yourself busy.</strong><span style=""color: rgb(55, 58, 65);""> Many people find it's best to quit on a Monday, when they have school or work to keep them busy. The more distracted you are, the less likely you'll be to crave cigarettes. </span><strong style=""color: rgb(55, 58, 65);"">Staying active is also a good distraction, </strong><span style=""color: rgb(55, 58, 65);"">plus it helps you keep your weight down and your energy up.</span></p><p><strong style=""color: rgb(55, 58, 65);"">Quit at your own pace.</strong><span style=""color: rgb(55, 58, 65);""> Some people find that gradually decreasing the number of cigarettes they smoke each day is an effective way to quit. But this doesn't work for everyone. You may find it's better for you to go ""cold turkey"" and stop smoking all at once.</span></p><p><strong style=""color: rgb(55, 58, 65);"">Look into using a nicotine replacement if you need to.</strong><span style=""color: rgb(55, 58, 65);""> If these strategies don't work for you, talk to your doctor about treatments like nicotine replacement gums, patches, inhalers, or nasal sprays. Sprays and inhalers are available by prescription only, and it's important to see your doctor before buying the patch or gum over the counter. Different treatments work differently (for example, the patch is easy to use, but other treatments offer a faster kick of nicotine). Your doctor can help you find the solution that will work best for you.</span></p><p><br></p><h3><span style=""color: rgb(13, 63, 99);"">What if I Smoke Again?</span></h3><p><strong style=""color: rgb(55, 58, 65);"">If you slip up, don't give up!</strong><span style=""color: rgb(55, 58, 65);""> Major changes sometimes take a few tries. If you're like many people, you may quit successfully for weeks or even months and then suddenly have a craving that's so strong you feel like you have to give in. Or maybe you accidentally find yourself in one of your trigger situations and give in to temptation.</span></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(55, 58, 65);"">If you slip up, it doesn't mean you've failed. It just means you're human. Here are 3 ways to get back on track:</span></p><ol><li data-list=""ordered""><strong style=""color: rgb(55, 58, 65);"">Think about your slip as one mistake.</strong><span style=""color: rgb(55, 58, 65);""> Take notice of when and why it happened and move on.</span></li><li data-list=""ordered""><strong style=""color: rgb(55, 58, 65);"">Keep it in perspective.</strong><span style=""color: rgb(55, 58, 65);""> You probably became a smoker gradually, over time. One cigarette didn't make you a smoker to start with, so smoking one cigarette (or even two or three) after you quit doesn't make you a smoker again.</span></li><li data-list=""ordered""><strong style=""color: rgb(55, 58, 65);"">Remind yourself why you quit and how well you've done</strong><span style=""color: rgb(55, 58, 65);""> — or have someone in your support group, family, or friends do this for you.</span></li></ol><p><br></p><h3><strong style=""color: rgb(13, 63, 99);"">Reward Yourself When You Succeed</strong></h3><p><span style=""color: rgb(55, 58, 65);"">Quitting smoking isn't easy. Give yourself a well-deserved reward! Set aside the money you usually spend on cigarettes. When you've stayed tobacco-free for a week, 2 weeks, or a month, give yourself a treat like a gift card, movie, or some clothes. Celebrate again every smoke-free year. You earned it.</span></p>",def44d9e-916a-4aa0-b686-e3a68b9e7ab0,https://aguihgvqrkbejqponncp.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/thumbnail/1748592843327-thumbnail1.jpg,how-can-i-quit-smoking

In some places, a pack of cigarettes costs more than $10, while the cost of electronic nicotine delivery systems including e-cigarettes and vapes can cost anywhere from $5 to $25—and prices keep rising. Think about how much you use and how much you spend per week or month, let alone a year! Now think about how much you can save.</span></p><p><br></p><h2><strong style=""color: rgb(13, 35, 84); background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">Your Convenience</strong></h2><p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">It's a hassle. More and more states and cities have passed clean indoor air laws that make bars, restaurants, and other public places tobacco-free. Are you tired of having to go outside many times a day? Is standing in the cold and the rain really worth it? Wouldn't it be easier if you could choose to go outside only when you want to and not when you need to?</span></p><p><br></p><h2><strong style=""color: rgb(13, 35, 84); background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">Your Friends and Family</strong></h2><p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">Secondhand and thirdhand smoke harms everyone who inhales it, not just the person using the product.

13,2025-06-01 07:55:21.066859+00,How to Quit Vaping,Here’s how to begin talking to your teen about quitting vaping and offer support.,"<p>If you’ve discovered that your teen is vaping, it’s only natural to feel a range of emotions. But remember to be patient and ready to listen. Your goal is to have a conversation with your teen.</p><p>So, first things first, remember that people who feel supported are more likely to quit vaping or smoking for good.</p><p>Secondly, keep in mind that nicotine affects your teen’s developing brain and causes addiction. And it will take time for their nicotine cravings to subside when they try to quit.</p><p>Finally, it could take many attempts for your teen to quit vaping for good. You might want to talk to a health care provider who can suggest effective nicotine cessation programs that help teens kick the habit.</p><h2>Vaping has become an epidemic</h2><p>Sharing the facts about vaping is a good starting point for a discussion with your teen.</p><p>The U.S. Surgeon General has called youth e-cigarette use an epidemic. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), about 4.7 million middle and high school students use at least one tobacco product, including e-cigarettes. In fact, 1 in 20 middle school students and 1 in 5 high school students reported in 2020 that they used e-cigarettes in the past 30 days.</p><p>Vaping is dangerous, it exposes users to dangerous particles and chemicals, and it exposes users to nicotine. Nicotine is highly addictive and can be a “gateway” to other addictive drugs. In addition, the CDC and other agencies are investigating cases of severe lung illness potentially associated with vaping.</p><p>After you’ve shared some important facts, try these five ways to help your teen quit vaping:</p><h2>1. Ask questions</h2><p>Your teen’s answers can help you find ways to be supportive.</p><ul><li>What made you want to start?</li><li>What triggers your cravings?</li><li>What’s been stressing you out?</li><li>How could I help make quitting easier?</li></ul><h2>2. Be Patient<br></h2><p>Remember withdrawal can cause irritability, so you’ll need to be as understanding as possible.</p><h2>3. Help them remove temptation</h2><p>Encourage your teen to get rid of all vaping devices and products. Most cravings will subside in less time than it takes to get access to e-cigarettes,&nbsp;<a href=""https://smokefree.gov/help-others-quit/how-to-support-someone-quitting"" target=""_blank"">according to smokefree.gov.</a></p><h2>4. Encourage them to have a plan</h2><p>Talk to your teen about how they will manage cravings and temptation if they are around peers who vape. Help them build a list of actions and activities they can use to distract themselves when cravings strike. The&nbsp;quitSTART app&nbsp;has games and challenges to help people quit. Many people find that keeping their hands busy with a stress ball or rubber band can help.</p><h2>5. Point them toward more help</h2><p><a href=""https://teen.smokefree.gov/quit-vaping"" target=""_blank"">Connect your teen with online resources</a>, such as&nbsp;<a href=""https://teen.smokefree.gov/quit-vaping"" target=""_blank"">smokefree.gov</a>&nbsp;and Texas’&nbsp;<a href=""https://yesquit.org/"" target=""_blank"">Yes Quit</a>, which can answer their questions and help them break the habit. Also encourage them to seek help through Harold C. Simmons Comprehensive Cancer Center’s&nbsp;<a href=""https://utswmed.org/cancer/community-outreach/manage-your-health/prevention/nicotine-cessation/"" target=""_blank"">free nicotine cessation program.</a></p><blockquote>""You’ve taken an important step by encouraging your teen to quit. But keep in mind that quitting any product that has nicotine is hard and can take many attempts. But your support can greatly help your teen quit.""<br></blockquote>",6887efa7-c300-456f-8a9d-fd5f504a7eb6,https://aguihgvqrkbejqponncp.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/thumbnail/1748764519060-thumbnail4.jpg,how-to-quit-vaping

While it can be hard at times, smoking can make it worse.","<p>Growing up is tough. Life as a teen or youth can be emotional, stressful, and overwhelming. While it can be hard at times,&nbsp;smoking&nbsp;can make it worse. Learn how to manage stressful situations without using harmful tobacco products like cigarettes and vape pens. </p><p>Whether tobacco is rolled or comes in a pen, it’s bad for your overall health. Nicotine is in all tobacco products. Not only is it addictive, but it also damages your brain. While you’re growing, your brain is still developing. You want to take great care of yourself, and smoking does the opposite.</p><p> How Smoking Affects Young People</p><p>Smoking can cause serious health issues immediately and well into adulthood. Young people who smoke can become addicted to nicotine, have early heart damage, and reduced lung growth. When you are young, active, and smoking, it can hurt your athletic ability and other physical activities. Smoking puts you at risk for&nbsp;cancer,&nbsp;diabetes, certain teeth&nbsp;&amp; gum diseases, bronchitis, and other immune system issues.</p><p>Nearly all tobacco use starts during youth, and it grows during young adulthood. More than 3,200 children under 18 smoke their first cigarette every day, according to the&nbsp;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Additionally, 90 percent of smokers start before they’re 18, and almost all start smoking by 26.</p><p>Prevention and Cessation: Talking to Children and Teens About Smoking</p><p>It’s easier to avoid smoking when you are young than it is to quit as an adult. If you’re a parent of a child or teen, talk to them about avoiding all tobacco use.</p><p>It can be a difficult conversation, but that doesn’t mean you should avoid it. Before starting the conversation, make sure you are ready to see it through to the end. Here are a few helpful tips:</p><ul><li><strong>Think of an approach based on your relationship</strong><strong>.</strong>&nbsp;Whether you have a close relationship or not, keep the smallest details in mind.</li><li><strong>Start the conversation on a positive note.</strong>&nbsp;If you noticed how well-behaved your child has been or their good grades in school, celebrate that success before moving into the discussion.</li><li><strong>Look for an opening or create one.</strong>&nbsp;Look for easy ways to change the topic to smoking. For example, you might ask, “Has anyone at school talked to you about smoking?” or “Do any of your friends smoke?”</li><li><strong>Ask questions and listen.</strong>&nbsp;You might ask, ""What made you want to start or think about smoking?” or “What can I do to help you to quit?” Remember, let your child talk while you listen.</li><li><strong>Remain patient and offer support.</strong>&nbsp;Stay present in the conversation, be calm while listening, and look for ways to show support.</li></ul><p>Make a Plan to Quit</p><p>If you or your child or teen is preparing to quit:</p><ul><li>Consider why you want to quit and connect it to a goal you can reach.</li><li>Create a plan to avoid things or people that make you want to smoke.</li><li>Stay away from situations and feelings that make you want to smoke.</li><li>Keep a positive mindset.Ask for support from close friends and family.</li></ul><p>If you need more support, Frederick Health’s&nbsp;Freedom from Smoking Program&nbsp;can help you pass through the stages of quitting, learn from setbacks, and move forward. During the free, 8-week, 8-session program, you’ll learn triggers, coping techniques, stress management, nutrition, weight management, relapse prevention, and more.</p><p>Additional Resources</p><p>There are many ways to support children, teens, and youth who want to become smoke-free. </p><ul><li><a href=""https://teen.smokefree.gov/become-smokefree/smokefreeteen-signup"" target=""_blank"">SmokefreeTXT for Teens</a>&nbsp;helps teens quit smoking.
